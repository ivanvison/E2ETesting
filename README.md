- Removing Hardcoded paths
- Headless execution
- Inheritance, Interfaces and Statics in the framework
- Consolidating test cases


## Setup
1. Clone this project.
2. Open data.properties file and edit path to drivers variable.
3. Open terminal/command prompt > go to project path > run command `mvn test`

## Prerequisites (my setup):
- Java JDK
- Maven, Selenium, TestNG, Extent Reports, etc dependencies
- Proper setup for System variables environment
- Eclipse IDE
- Jenkins

## What's next for this E2EProject
1. Refactor
2. Try to improve how the login and forgot password is being handled during the test
3. Understand a little bit more about methods, objects and constructors
